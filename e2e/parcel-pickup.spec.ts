/**
 * Parcel Pickup Feature Tests (Smoke Tests)
 *
 * Philosophy: Test that pages load and basic UI elements exist - NO data mutations
 * - ✅ Test that household detail pages load
 * - ✅ Test that parcel admin dialog structure exists
 * - ✅ Test that API endpoint responds correctly
 * - ❌ Do NOT actually mark parcels as picked up (would affect database)
 * - ❌ Do NOT assume specific data exists
 *
 * These tests verify the critical bug fixes:
 * - Finding #1: POST/PATCH method mismatch (fixed)
 * - Finding #2: Refresh after pickup (fixed)
