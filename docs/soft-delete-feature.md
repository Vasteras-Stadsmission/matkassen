## Business Logic

### Deletion Rules

A parcel can be soft-deleted if and only if:

1. ✅ **Parcel exists** and is not already deleted
2. ✅ **Not picked up** (`is_picked_up = false`)
3. ✅ **Not in the past** (current time < `pickup_date_time_latest`)
4. ✅ **User is authenticated** as admin

### SMS Handling Strategy

The system uses intelligent SMS cancellation based on notification status:

| SMS Status                        | Action                                                              | Rationale                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `queued` or `sending`             | **Silent cancellation** - Update SMS status to `cancelled`          | SMS hasn't been sent yet, so household never received notification |
| `sent`                            | **Send cancellation SMS** - Queue new SMS with cancellation message | Household was notified, so they must be informed of cancellation   |
| `failed`, `retrying`, `cancelled` | **No action**                                                       | No notification was successfully delivered                         |
| No SMS record                     | **No action**                                                       | Household was never going to receive SMS                           |

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Queued SMS

```
Admin deletes parcel → SMS marked as "cancelled" → Household never receives any SMS
Result: Clean cancellation, no confusion
```

#### Scenario 2: Sent SMS

```
Admin deletes parcel → New cancellation SMS queued → Household receives:
  "Food pickup Wed 15 Oct 14:30 is cancelled."
Result: Household is properly informed
```

#### Scenario 3: No SMS

```
Admin deletes parcel → No SMS action → Parcel simply marked deleted
Result: Silent deletion (household wasn't going to be notified anyway)
```

## Database Schema

### Migrations

#### Migration `0021_add-soft-delete-to-food-parcels.sql`

Added soft delete infrastructure:

```sql
-- Add soft delete fields to food_parcels table
ALTER TABLE food_parcels
ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP(1) WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN deleted_by_user_id VARCHAR(50);

-- Create index for efficient soft delete queries
CREATE INDEX idx_food_parcels_deleted_at
ON food_parcels(deleted_at)
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;
```

#### Migration `0022_fix-soft-delete-unique-constraint.sql` ⭐

**Critical Bug Fix:** Replaced standard unique constraint with partial unique index to allow parcel recreation after soft-delete.

**Problem:** The original `UNIQUE(household_id, pickup_location_id, pickup_date_time_earliest, pickup_date_time_latest)` constraint applied to ALL rows, including soft-deleted ones. This prevented admins from recreating a parcel after deletion because the deleted row still "occupied" that slot.

**Solution:** Partial unique index that only enforces uniqueness for active (non-deleted) parcels:

```sql
-- Drop the constraint that was blocking recreation
ALTER TABLE food_parcels
DROP CONSTRAINT food_parcels_household_location_time_unique;

-- Create partial unique index (only active parcels)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX food_parcels_household_location_time_active_unique
ON food_parcels(household_id, pickup_location_id, pickup_date_time_earliest, pickup_date_time_latest)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Allows recreating parcels after soft-delete (critical business requirement)
- ✅ Still prevents duplicate active parcels (same household/location/time)
- ✅ Preserves historical data (multiple deleted parcels with same values allowed)
- ✅ Better performance (index only contains active parcels)

### Schema Fields

```typescript
// app/db/schema.ts
export const foodParcels = pgTable("food_parcels", {
    // ... existing fields
    deleted_at: timestamp({ precision: 1, withTimezone: true }),
    deleted_by_user_id: varchar("deleted_by_user_id", { length: 50 }),
});
```

### Query Helper

```typescript
// app/db/query-helpers.ts
export const notDeleted = () => sql`deleted_at IS NULL`;

// Usage:
const activeParcels = await db
    .select()
    .from(foodParcels)
    .where(
        and(
            eq(foodParcels.household_id, householdId),
            notDeleted(), // ← Filters out soft-deleted parcels
        ),
    );
```

**Implementation:** `app/api/admin/parcel/[parcelId]/route.ts`

---

## UI Components

### Delete Button (ParcelAdminDialog.tsx)

**Location:** `components/ParcelAdminDialog.tsx` (line 220+)

**Features:**

- 🔴 Red "Delete parcel" button
- ⚠️ Confirmation modal with warning message
- 🔄 Loading state during deletion
- ✅ Success notification with UI refresh
- ❌ Error notification with details

**User Flow:**

```
1. Admin clicks "Delete parcel" button
2. Confirmation modal appears:
   "Are you sure you want to delete this parcel?"
   "This will cancel the parcel and notify the household via SMS
    if the SMS hasn't been sent yet."
3. Admin confirms
4. API call executes
5. Success: Parcel removed from UI + notification shown
   Error: Error message displayed, parcel remains
```

**Code Example:**

```typescript
<Button
    color="red"
    onClick={() => {
        modals.openConfirmModal({
            title: t("admin.parcelDialog.deleteConfirmTitle"),
            children: (
                <Text size="sm">
                    {t("admin.parcelDialog.deleteConfirmMessage")}
                </Text>
            ),
            labels: {
                confirm: t("admin.parcelDialog.deleteConfirm"),
                cancel: t("common.cancel"),
            },
            confirmProps: { color: "red" },
            onConfirm: async () => {
                // Deletion logic
            },
        });
    }}
>
    {t("admin.parcelDialog.deleteParcel")}
</Button>
```

### Public Parcel Page

**Location:** `app/p/[parcelId]/page.tsx`

**Deleted Parcel Handling:**

- Shows "Cancelled" status with warning icon
- Prevents QR code display
- Displays cancellation message in all 20+ supported languages
- No pickup action buttons

---

## SMS Integration

### Cancellation Message Templates

**Function:** `generateCancellationSmsText()`
**Location:** `app/utils/sms/templates.ts`

**Message Format:**

```
[Food type] [Day] [Date] [Time] is cancelled.
Example: "Food pickup Wed 15 Oct 14:30 is cancelled."
```

**Supported Languages:** 21 languages with proper date/time formatting

- Arabic, English, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Spanish, Swedish, etc.

**SMS Length Optimization:**

- All messages < 160 characters (single SMS)
- Tested for cost efficiency
- Localized date formats respected

### SMS Queue Processing

When a cancellation SMS is queued:

1. Record inserted into `outgoing_sms` table
2. Status: `queued`
3. `next_attempt_at`: Immediate (current timestamp)
4. Background processor picks up on next cycle (every 30 seconds in production)
5. SMS sent via 46elks API
6. Status updated to `sent` or `failed`

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Test Case 1: Delete Future Parcel (No SMS)

1. Navigate to schedule page
2. Click on a future parcel (no SMS sent)
3. Click "Delete parcel" button
4. Confirm deletion
5. ✅ Parcel disappears from schedule
6. ✅ Success notification shown
7. ✅ Database: `deleted_at` and `deleted_by_user_id` set

#### Test Case 2: Delete Parcel with Queued SMS

1. Create a new parcel (SMS auto-queued)
2. Immediately delete before SMS sends
3. ✅ SMS status changed to "cancelled"
4. ✅ No SMS received by household
5. ✅ Parcel soft-deleted

#### Test Case 3: Delete Parcel with Sent SMS

1. Wait for SMS to be sent (check `outgoing_sms` table)
2. Delete the parcel
3. ✅ New cancellation SMS queued
4. ✅ Household receives cancellation notification
5. ✅ Parcel soft-deleted

#### Test Case 4: Validation Failures

1. Try to delete picked up parcel → ❌ Error: "Cannot delete picked up parcel"
2. Try to delete past parcel → ❌ Error: "Cannot delete past parcel"
3. Try to delete already deleted parcel → ❌ 404 Not Found

#### Test Case 5: Public Page Display

1. Get parcel ID of deleted parcel
2. Visit `/p/[parcelId]`
3. ✅ Shows "Cancelled" status
4. ✅ Warning message displayed
5. ✅ No QR code shown
6. ✅ No pickup buttons

### Performance Testing

- Deletion completes in < 1 second
- No impact on concurrent operations (unique constraints prevent issues)
- Index on `deleted_at` ensures fast queries

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization

**Every deletion requires:**

1. ✅ Valid NextAuth session (GitHub OAuth)
2. ✅ Organization membership verification
3. ✅ Admin role (all authenticated users are admins)

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// API Route Protection
const authResult = await authenticateAdminRequest();
if (!authResult.success) {
    return authResult.response!; // 401 Unauthorized
}

// Server Action Protection
export const softDeleteParcel = protectedAction(async (session, parcelId: string) => {
    // session is guaranteed to be valid
    // session.user.githubUsername is available
});
```

### Input Validation

**Parcel ID Format:**

- Must be 12 or 14 characters (legacy support)
- Alphanumeric + underscore/hyphen (nanoid charset)
- Regex: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{12,14}$/`

**Database Transaction Safety:**

- All operations wrapped in transaction
- Rollback on any error
- ACID guarantees maintained

### Audit Trail

Every deletion records:

- **When:** `deleted_at` timestamp (precision to 0.1 seconds)
- **Who:** `deleted_by_user_id` (GitHub username)
- **What:** Parcel ID remains in database (soft delete)

**Query deleted parcels:**

```sql
SELECT
    id,
    deleted_at,
    deleted_by_user_id,
    pickup_date_time_earliest,
    household_id
FROM food_parcels
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY deleted_at DESC;
```

### Rate Limiting

- Inherits from existing API rate limiting middleware
- Per-IP and per-user limits apply
- Prevents abuse of deletion endpoint

## Internationalization

### Admin UI Messages (English)

```json
{
    "admin": {
        "parcelDialog": {
            "deleteParcel": "Delete parcel",
            "deleteConfirmTitle": "Delete parcel?",
            "deleteConfirmMessage": "This will cancel the parcel and notify the household via SMS if the SMS hasn't been sent yet.",
            "deleteConfirm": "Delete parcel",
            "deleteSuccess": "Parcel deleted successfully",
            "deleteError": "Failed to delete parcel"
        }
    }
}
```

### Public Cancellation Messages (21 Languages)

Examples:

- **English:** "Food pickup Wed 15 Oct 14:30 is cancelled."
- **Swedish:** "Matpaket ons 15 okt. 14:30 är inställt."
- **Arabic:** "تم إلغاء استلام الطعام ١٥ أكتوبر ١٤:٣٠."
- **Farsi:** "دریافت غذا ۲۳ مهر ۱۴:٣۰ لغو شد."

All messages optimized for SMS length limits (< 160 characters).

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **No undo functionality** - Once deleted, requires manual database intervention to restore
2. **No bulk delete** - Must delete parcels one at a time
3. **No deletion history UI** - Admins can't view deleted parcels in the UI (database query required)

### Potential Future Features

1. **Restore functionality** - Allow admins to undelete recently deleted parcels
2. **Bulk operations** - Delete multiple parcels at once
3. **Deletion history page** - View audit trail of deleted parcels
4. **Custom cancellation reasons** - Let admins specify why parcel was cancelled
5. **Automatic deletion** - Auto-delete old parcels after X days
6. **Export deleted parcels** - Download CSV of deletion history

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Delete button does nothing

**Cause:** ModalsProvider not configured
**Solution:** Ensure `ModalsProvider` wraps app in `app/client-providers.tsx`

#### 400 Bad Request

**Cause:** Parcel ID validation failing
**Solution:** Check parcel ID length (must be 12 or 14 characters)

#### 409 Already Picked Up

**Cause:** Trying to delete a picked up parcel
**Solution:** Cannot delete picked up parcels - this is by design

#### SMS not sent

**Cause:** Background processor may not be running
**Solution:** Check SMS queue processing logs, verify 46elks credentials

### Debug Logging

Extensive logging added for debugging:

```typescript
// API endpoint logs
console.log("[DELETE /api/admin/parcel] Starting request");
console.log("[DELETE /api/admin/parcel] Auth successful:", username);
console.log("[DELETE /api/admin/parcel] Parcel ID:", parcelId, "Length:", length);

// Action logs
console.log("[softDeleteParcel] Starting with parcelId:", parcelId);
console.log("[softDeleteParcel] Query result length:", parcelResult.length);
console.log("[softDeleteParcel] Parcel found:", { id, isPickedUp, dates });
console.log("[softDeleteParcel] SMS records found:", smsRecords.length);
```

Check server logs when debugging deletion issues.

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why Soft Delete Instead of Hard Delete?

1. **Audit Trail:** Need to know what parcels were cancelled and by whom
2. **Analytics:** Historical data valuable for understanding usage patterns
3. **Recovery:** Mistakes happen - soft delete allows recovery if needed
4. **Referential Integrity:** Other records may reference parcel IDs
5. **SMS Records:** Need to maintain connection between SMS and original parcel

### Why Transaction-Based?

Ensures atomicity of:

- Parcel soft delete
- SMS status update
- Cancellation SMS queuing

All operations succeed together or none do - prevents data inconsistency.

### Why Index on deleted_at?

**Query Pattern:**

```sql
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL  -- Frequently used to filter active parcels
```

**Index Definition:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_food_parcels_deleted_at
ON food_parcels(deleted_at)
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;  -- Partial index, smaller footprint
```

**Benefit:** Fast active parcel queries without scanning deleted records.
