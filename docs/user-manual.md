## Parcel Scheduling

### Overview

Parcels represent scheduled food pickups at specific dates/times. The scheduling system has two main views optimized for different tasks.

### Schedule Hub

Central dashboard showing all pickup locations:

- Each location card shows today's count (completed/total)
- Click location to view its schedule
- Favorite locations (‚≠ê) get "Today's Handouts" shortcut in navigation

### Today's Handouts View

Optimized for daily operations:

- Shows only today's parcels at selected location
- Grouped by time slots
- Progress indicator (X completed / Y total)
- Pull-to-refresh on mobile
- Manual refresh button
- Click parcel row to open details

**Status indicators**:

- üü¢ **Upcoming**: Future parcel, not picked up
- ‚úÖ **Picked Up**: Collected (shows timestamp and admin who marked it)

**Best for**: Daily pickup operations, marking parcels as picked up.

### Weekly View

Optimized for planning:

- Calendar grid showing entire week
- Week navigation (arrows or date picker)
- See capacity across multiple days
- Drag-and-drop rescheduling (if supported)

**Best for**: Forward planning, seeing patterns, managing capacity.

### Creating Parcels

Parcels can be created from:

1. Schedule page (weekly view)
2. Household wizard (step 6)
3. Household details (Manage Parcels)

**Required information**:

- Household (must exist first)
- Pickup location
- Date and time window (start ‚Üí end)

**Validation rules**:

- Pickup time must be in future
- Cannot double-book same household at same time/location
- Location capacity checked (soft limit - warns but allows)
- Household must have valid phone number

**Automatic SMS**:
When parcel created, SMS queues with **5-minute grace period**:

- Sends 5 minutes before pickup start time
- If you edit within grace period, old SMS cancelled, new one queued
- Prevents sending incorrect information

### Marking Parcels as Picked Up

1. Open parcel details dialog
2. Click "Mark as Picked Up"
3. Records: timestamp, admin username
4. Status changes immediately
5. Dialog stays open (can add comments)

**To undo**: Click "Undo Pickup" in same dialog. Clears all pickup information.

**Why mark pickups**:

- Accurate statistics and reporting
- Progress tracking in today's view
- Historical record of completed distributions

### Rescheduling Parcels

**Manual reschedule**:

1. Open parcel dialog ‚Üí Click "Reschedule"
2. Select new date and time
3. Confirm change

**Drag-and-drop** (if available):

1. Drag parcel card to new slot in weekly view
2. Confirm in dialog
3. Shows capacity warnings if slot is full

**SMS behavior**:

- **Within grace period**: Old SMS cancelled, new SMS queued (one SMS total)
- **After SMS sent**: Update SMS sent with new information (two SMS total)

**Constraints**:

- Can only reschedule to same location
- Cannot reschedule past parcels
- Cannot reschedule already picked-up parcels

### Deleting Parcels

1. Open parcel dialog
2. Click "Delete Parcel" (bottom left)
3. Confirmation warns about SMS impact
4. Confirm deletion

**SMS behavior**:

- **Before SMS sent**: SMS cancelled, recipient never notified
- **After SMS sent**: Cancellation SMS queued (1-minute grace period)

Cancellation SMS informs recipient not to come.

**Cannot delete**:

- Already picked-up parcels
- Past parcels (pickup time passed)

Deleted parcels are soft-deleted (marked deleted_at, remain in database for audit trail).

### Parcel Details and History

Parcel dialog shows:

- Household information
- Pickup details (location, date, time)
- Status and pickup information
- SMS history (all notifications sent)
- Comments (admin notes)
- QR code (for public page)
- Action buttons

From here you can:

- Mark/unmark as picked up
- Add comments
- Reschedule or delete
- Copy public link or QR code

### Sharing Parcels with Recipients

Two methods:

1. **Automatic SMS**: Sent automatically when parcel created

Public link format: `https://matkassen.org/p/[parcelId]`

Recipient can open link to see pickup details and QR code (no login required).

### Favorite Locations

Set one location as favorite for quick access:

1. Click ‚≠ê icon next to location name
2. Confirm in dialog
3. "Today's Handouts" shortcut appears in navigation

## SMS Dashboard

### Overview

SMS Dashboard monitors all SMS notifications related to food parcel pickups. Has two separate views for different purposes:

1. **Default view** (active parcels): Your operational work queue
2. **Cancelled view** (toggle ON): Audit trail of cancelled parcels

**Design principle**: SMS follows parcel state automatically. You manage parcels in schedule, and SMS updates accordingly. Dashboard is for monitoring and recovery.

### Two-View System

The dashboard shows either active or cancelled parcels, never both:

**Active Parcels View** (default):

- Shows SMS for parcels that are NOT deleted/cancelled
- Your day-to-day operational work queue
- What needs attention right now
- Toggle OFF or omitted

**Cancelled Parcels View** (toggle ON):

- Shows SMS for parcels that ARE deleted/cancelled
- Audit trail of cancellations
- Verify households were notified (`pickup_cancelled` SMS)
- Historical record of what was cancelled

Switch between views using the **Show cancelled parcels** toggle in the filters section.

### Dashboard Layout

Date-grouped list view:

- Groups: "TODAY", "TOMORROW", specific dates
- Each SMS entry shows:
    - Household name
    - Pickup time and location
    - SMS status badge
    - Action button (context-aware)
    - Three-dot menu
- Click row to open parcel admin dialog

### SMS Status Meanings

- üïí **Queued**: Waiting to send (shows scheduled send time)
- üì§ **Sending**: Currently being sent
- ‚úÖ **Sent**: Successfully delivered
- üîÑ **Retrying**: Auto-retry after temporary failure
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Failed**: Send failed, needs attention
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Cancelled**: Parcel was deleted

### Filtering and Search

Available filters:

- **Location**: Show SMS for specific pickup location
- **Status**: Filter by SMS status
- **Search**: Find by household name
- **Show cancelled parcels**: Toggle between active/cancelled views

Filters sync to URL for sharing and refresh persistence.

Clear all filters with "Clear Filters" button (note: cancelled toggle separate).

### Viewing Cancelled Parcels

To see SMS for cancelled/deleted parcels:

1. Toggle **Show cancelled parcels** switch ON
2. Dashboard switches to show ONLY cancelled parcels
3. All other filters still work (location, status, search)
4. Toggle OFF to return to active parcels view

**Common use cases**:

- Verify a household received cancellation notification
- Audit what parcels were cancelled this week
- Check if `pickup_cancelled` SMS sent successfully
- Review historical cancellations

**Important**: The two views are mutually exclusive. You see either active parcels OR cancelled parcels, never both together. This keeps the operational view clean and focused.

### SMS Actions

**Context-aware send button**:

- Failed SMS: "Try Again"
- Sent SMS: "Send Again"
- Queued SMS: "Send Now"

Clicking sends immediately, bypassing grace period.

**Three-dot menu**:

- Send SMS (context-aware)
- View Household
- View Parcel

### Handling Failed SMS

1. Failed SMS shows error message in English
2. Common issues:
    - Invalid phone number
    - Insufficient account balance
    - Technical issues
3. Fix underlying issue (usually phone number)
4. Click "Try Again" to resend

SMS Dashboard shows failure count in navigation badge for quick awareness.

### Understanding Automatic SMS

**When parcel created**:

- SMS queues with intent: `pickup_reminder`
- 5-minute grace period before sending
- Edits within grace period cancel old SMS, queue new one

**When parcel edited** (after SMS sent):

- Update SMS queues with intent: `pickup_updated`
- Informs recipient of changes
- 5-minute grace period applies

**When parcel deleted** (after SMS sent):

- Cancellation SMS queues with intent: `pickup_cancelled`
- 1-minute grace period (allows quick undo)
- Informs recipient not to come

**Multiple edits within grace period**:

- Each edit cancels previous SMS
- Only final version sends
- Prevents SMS spam to recipients

### Sending Urgent SMS

Use "Send Now" to bypass grace period:

- SMS sends immediately
- No confirmation dialog
- Use for time-sensitive situations

**When to use**:

- Recipient called asking about parcel
- Last-minute parcel additions
- Emergency changes

### Investigating Delivery Issues

If recipient reports not receiving SMS:

1. Search for their name in dashboard
2. Check status:
    - **Queued**: Hasn't sent yet (check scheduled time)
    - **Failed**: Check error message
    - **Sent**: SMS was delivered successfully
3. View parcel details for full SMS history
4. Use "Send Again" if needed
5. Alternatively, share public link directly

## Pickup Location Management

### Overview

Pickup locations are physical sites where households collect food parcels. Each location has its own schedule configuration and capacity limits.

### Creating Locations

1. Go to Pickup Locations page
2. Click "Add Location"
3. Fill in form:
    - **Name**: Short, clear identifier (e.g., "Centrum", "V√§ster")
    - **Street address**: Full street address
    - **Postal code**: Swedish format (5 digits)
    - **City**: City name
    - **Capacity**: Max parcels per time slot (optional)
4. Click "Create Location"

Location immediately available for scheduling.

**Naming best practices**:

- Keep short (appears in dropdowns)
- Use recognizable landmarks or areas
- Be consistent
- Avoid addresses in name (use address field)

### Location Details Page

Tabbed interface with one tab per location:

- Click tab to view/edit location
- Shows location form with current values
- Schedule configuration section below

### Editing Locations

1. Select location tab
2. Update any field
3. Click "Update Location"

**Impact of changes**:

- Name: Affects all references (use caution)
- Address: Doesn't affect already-sent SMS
- Capacity: Only affects future scheduling

**Cannot delete** locations with upcoming parcels. Must reschedule or delete parcels first.

### Configuring Schedules

Schedule defines when location is open and what time slots are available:

1. Select location tab
2. Go to "Opening Hours and Schedule" section
3. For each day of week:
    - Toggle on/off
    - Set opening and closing time
    - Set time slot duration (30, 60, 120 minutes, or custom)
4. Preview shows example time slots
5. Click "Save Schedule"

**Slot duration options**:

- 30 minutes: High traffic locations
- 60 minutes: Standard (recommended)
- 120 minutes: Flexible pickup windows

Schedule affects available time slots for **new parcels only**. Existing parcels unchanged.

### Capacity Management

Capacity = maximum parcels per time slot.

**How it works**:

- Counts total parcels in slot (upcoming + picked up)
- Warns when limit reached
- Does NOT prevent scheduling (soft limit)

**Setting capacity**:

- Leave empty for unlimited
- Set based on physical space and staffing
- Typical: 10-20 parcels per hour slot

**Capacity warnings**:

- Shows when creating/rescheduling parcels
- Helps avoid overcrowding
- Admin can override if necessary

### Location Statistics

Some locations may show usage statistics:

- Total parcels scheduled
- Weekly/monthly counts
- Peak hours
- Completion rates

Use for planning staffing and optimizing schedules.
