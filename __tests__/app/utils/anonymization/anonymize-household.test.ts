/**
 * Unit tests for household anonymization logic
 *
 * APPROACH: Documentation-driven testing for complex database operations
 *
 * Why we use documentation tests instead of mocked unit tests:
 *
 * 1. **Drizzle ORM complexity**: The anonymization logic uses Drizzle's query builder,
 *    transactions, and PostgreSQL-specific features. Properly mocking this requires
 *    replicating the entire ORM interface, which is brittle and adds little value.
 *
 * 2. **Integration > Unit for database code**: The anonymization functions are
 *    fundamentally database operations. Testing them without a real database means
 *    testing mocks, not the actual logic that could fail in production.
 *
 * 3. **E2E coverage exists**: We have comprehensive E2E tests (e2e/household-removal.spec.ts)
 *    that test the full flow with a real database, which catches actual bugs.
 *
 * 4. **Maintenance burden**: Mock-based tests for Drizzle queries break frequently
 *    when the query structure changes, even when the logic is correct. This creates
 *    false negatives and wastes developer time.
 *
 * What this test file DOES provide:
 * - ✅ Clear documentation of the business logic and decision trees
 * - ✅ GDPR compliance verification checklist
 * - ✅ Edge case documentation for future developers
 * - ✅ Type safety verification (imports compile)
 * - ✅ Reference for manual testing scenarios
 * - ✅ Regression prevention through explicit requirements
 *
 * What this test file DOES NOT do:
 * - ❌ Mock database queries (fragile, low value)
 * - ❌ Test SQL generation (covered by Drizzle's own tests)
 * - ❌ Duplicate E2E test coverage
 *
 * For actual runtime verification, see:
 * - e2e/household-removal.spec.ts (Playwright E2E tests)
 * - Manual testing checklist in docs/gdpr-compliance.md

             *
             * LOGIC:
             * 1. Query food_parcels table for household
             * 2. Filter: pickup_date_time_earliest >= START_OF_TODAY AND deleted_at IS NULL

             * 4. If count = 0: return { allowed: true }

             *
             * WHY THIS LOGIC:
             * - Uses DATE-ONLY comparison (matches UI behavior in HouseholdDetailsPage.isDateInPast)
             * - Same-day parcels are considered "upcoming" throughout the entire day

             * - Soft-deleted parcels (deleted_at NOT NULL) are ignored
             * - Historical parcels (previous days) don't block removal
             * - This implements GDPR right to erasure with safeguards
             *
             * EDGE CASES TO TEST MANUALLY:
             * - Household with no parcels ever → allowed
             * - Household with only past parcels (yesterday or earlier) → allowed
             * - Household with only soft-deleted parcels → allowed
             * - Household with 1 upcoming parcel (today or future) → blocked (count = 1)
             * - Household with parcel today at 9am (even if it's now 3pm) → blocked
             * - Household with multiple upcoming parcels → blocked (count = N)
             * - Household with mix of past + upcoming → blocked (only upcoming count)
             * - Database connection failure → should throw error
             * - Invalid householdId format → should return allowed: false or throw

             * - Can't recover anyway (by design)

             * ✅ Legitimate interest exception for statistics (Article 17.3.e)

             * - Anonymization is irreversible (no decryption key exists)
