/**
 * @vitest-environment node
 *
 * Tests for SMS Dashboard API endpoint
 *
 * Coverage areas:
 * 1. Authentication and authorization
 * 2. Query construction with filters (location, status, search, cancelled)
 * 3. Two-view system: active parcels (default) vs cancelled parcels (toggle)
 * 4. INNER JOIN ensures only SMS with valid parcels are returned
 * 5. Time window logic - parcels visible until pickup window ends (pickup_date_time_latest)
 *
 * Note: These are focused unit tests that verify the API's filtering logic
 * without requiring full database integration. The key behaviors tested are:
 * - Authentication is required
 * - notDeleted() filter for active parcels (default view)
 * - isDeleted() filter for cancelled parcels (when cancelled=true)
 * - Filter parameters are correctly parsed from query string
 * - Time window logic uses pickup_date_time_latest (not earliest)

/**
 * Integration test documentation for SMS Dashboard
 *
 * The following behaviors should be verified through integration testing with database fixtures:
 *
 * 1. **Two-view system for parcel filtering**:
 *    - Default view (cancelled=false or omitted): Shows SMS for active parcels only
 *      * Uses `notDeleted()` filter (WHERE is_null(deleted_at))
 *      * Operational dashboard for managing upcoming pickups
 *    - Cancelled view (cancelled=true): Shows SMS for soft-deleted parcels only
 *      * Uses `isDeleted()` filter (WHERE is_not_null(deleted_at))
 *      * Audit view for tracking cancellations and verifying households were notified
 *      * Includes `pickup_cancelled` SMS records that reference deleted parcels
 *
 * 2. **INNER JOIN behavior**:
 *    - Only SMS with valid parcel_id (non-null and exists) are returned
 *    - INNER JOIN between outgoing_sms and food_parcels ensures data integrity
 *    - SMS with null parcel_id would be excluded (defensive against FK SET NULL)
 *
 * 3. **Filter combinations**:
 *    - Location filter: WHERE pickup_locations.id = ?
 *    - Status filter: WHERE outgoing_sms.status = ?
 *    - Search filter: Applied to household first_name and last_name
 *    - Date filter: WHERE food_parcels.pickup_date_time_latest >= NOW()
 *    - Cancelled filter: WHERE is_null(deleted_at) OR is_not_null(deleted_at)
 *
 * 4. **Data integrity**:
 *    - All returned SMS have valid parcel, household, and location data
 *    - Active and cancelled parcels are shown in separate views (mutually exclusive)
 *    - Only upcoming parcels are shown (past parcels excluded by date filter)
 *    - Cancellation SMS become visible when switching to cancelled view
 *
 * 5. **Time window behavior** (CRITICAL):
 *    - Parcels remain visible until their pickup window ENDS (pickup_date_time_latest)
 *    - NOT when the window BEGINS (pickup_date_time_earliest)
 *    - Example: Parcel with pickup window 10:00-14:00 remains visible until 14:00
 *    - Failed SMS during active pickup window stay visible for staff to address
 *
 * Integration test scenarios to implement:
 *
 * Scenario 1: Time window visibility
 *   Given: Current time is 11:00
 *   And: Parcel A has pickup window 09:00-13:00 (started, not ended)
 *   And: Parcel B has pickup window 14:00-16:00 (not started)
 *   And: Parcel C has pickup window 08:00-10:00 (ended)
 *   When: GET /api/admin/sms/dashboard
 *   Then: Returns SMS for Parcel A and B (not C)
 *   And: Parcel A is visible even though pickup_date_time_earliest < now
 *
 * Scenario 2: Failed SMS during active pickup
 *   Given: Current time is 11:00
 *   And: Parcel has pickup window 10:00-14:00
 *   And: SMS has status "failed"
 *   When: GET /api/admin/sms/dashboard?status=failed
 *   Then: Returns the failed SMS (visible during active window)
 *
 * Scenario 3: Cancelled parcel view toggle
 *   Given: Parcel A is active (deleted_at = null)
 *   And: Parcel B is cancelled (deleted_at = timestamp)
 *   When: GET /api/admin/sms/dashboard
 *   Then: Returns SMS for Parcel A only
 *   When: GET /api/admin/sms/dashboard?cancelled=true
 *   Then: Returns SMS for Parcel B only
 *
 * These integration tests require a test database with fixtures.
 * The unit tests above validate authentication and parameter parsing.
